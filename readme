# Node.js Express REST API

This project is a simple RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It demonstrates the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ideal for learning how APIs work with HTTP requests and JSON data.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js
- **UUID** – For generating unique IDs
- **Nodemon** – Automatically restarts the server on changes

---
